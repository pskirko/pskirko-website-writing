Super Resolution has launched in Photoshop. Actually, in Adobe Camera Raw. You can now effectively double an image’s resolution without blurriness. Which is truly, truly awesome.

I had been expecting this moment for a few years now. It was clear deep learning was a great fit for super-resolution, so it was only a matter of time before it reached mainstream availability in Photoshop.

This is a tremendous opportunity for millions of photographers (from pros to hobbyists to just everyday people) with lower-res photos. They can take those photos, upscale them, and either re-crop for online use, print larger, etc.

Congrats Adobe. This is such a helpful capability to have, and it will only get better.

# Info For Recruiters

*The opinions stated here are my own, not those of my company.*

This page is information that should be useful for recruiters. Last update January 2019.

Right now, I’m pretty happy in my current role, and my current manager chain (my manager, their manager, etc) is the best I’ve ever had. So I don’t have any intention of exploring new roles at the moment.

But, things change. Managers leave. Teams get reorganized. Projects go south. And so on. I have the suspicion that some software engineers think they are pretty much guaranteed employment and career-happiness for life. I believe many of them are overly optimistic. Having been around for both the Dot Com Bust and the Great Recession, I’ve seen otherwise.

Andy Grove wrote a book called [Only The Paranoid Survive](https://www.amazon.com/Only-Paranoid-Survive-Exploit-Challenge/dp/0385483821). To be honest, I haven’t read it yet. But I know it’s about his time leading Intel through intense competition and changes in the semiconductor industry landscape. “Paranoia” might be too alarmist for daily mental consideration, but every software engineer who doesn’t have a safety net so big (from a previous exit, etc) that they could retire tomorrow needs to be reasonably circumspect about the future, in my opinion. Especially once you’re over 35. Age-based discrimination will always be a problem. “Regulation” and other systemic ways of dealing with it will always lag reality by 5-10 years. The only way I see to deal with it is that I’m constantly investing in my core skills, which generally happens in off-job hours.

So hence my paradox. While I am happy now, it is a happiness I only partially control the destiny of. Many, many random variables are involved.

If you are recruiter looking to “chat”, my current reply is “thanks, not interested now, check back in 6-12 months”.

In my experience, recruiters of small companies (i.e. startups) over-emphasize the mission/purpose aspect of their company. That is, they want to find employees who really, truly believe that their company is going to change the world or an industry in X ways, and who are willing to make great sacrifices to give it a try (this is doubly ironic since I read LinkedIn and can see how often recruiters flip their own roles). Sure, maybe if you’re fresh out of college, or have a big safety net and can take big risks. But I’m nearing 40, have a wife and two kids, and are a single income family in California, one the least affordable places in the US. So when a recruiter focuses on idealism, it often comes across as the wrong tone for me, and it highlights that you probably haven’t done your homework (aka read my LinkedIn profile) and are just spamming me. Recruiters from big companies generally are much more straightforward about what they are pitching, and I appreciate that.

Recruiters of small companies (i.e. startups) are also way, way too vague in their communications. A startup is a tradeoff. Financially, you trade the relative stability and higher present cash flow of a profitable big company, in exchange for a much smaller present cash flow with a probabilistic future cash flow (ie successful exit) whose expected value across the industry is strictly negative (negative, due to the lost value of staying with big company and saving the cash flows wisely).

But it’s not just financial. The tradeoffs are many: management chain, team quality, code quality, role and opportunity, level of stress, commute/remote, and so on. I’d like to really flesh out my thoughts here later on. It’s important not just to me, but others who are new in their career.

But as I said, startup recruiters tend to be really vague here. Again, I feel like you haven’t done your homework. Maybe that works with someone younger. But not me. I’d really prefer if you were direct in what you are offering. Please be clear if this is an individual contributor role, or a leadership one. Either way, I want to know my entire possible management chain in the first email, and key team members I would directly work with. Send me all their LinkedIn profiles, and if I’m interested, I would definitely read every one. And finally, be upfront about salary range. In the days of Glassdoor, these numbers are not a secret anymore, nor should they ever be. Even big companies could do a better job of getting this detailed, but I have limited expectations from big companies because their recruiting machinery is pretty standardized and operates at a massive scale. Small companies can be much more crafty and nimble on this front, and if you’re not, you’re missing one of your competitive advantages.

And finally, this is all meant sincerely. I will probably turn down roles that will end up financially or career-wise lucrative for the people that took them. Part of the problem is choosing the winners from the losers, so to speak. I am driven not by hubris but by more mundane considerations of how I am going to pay for college and retire without undue burden.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I’ll update this doc from time to time.

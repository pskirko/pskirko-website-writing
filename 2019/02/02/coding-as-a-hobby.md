### Who is this post for?

You should read this post if you are trying to figure out how best to make
coding a part of your life outside work. If you have questions or stories to
share, please comment!

### Introduction

In this post, I explain my perspective on coding as a regimen. I contrast the
regimen approach with a more prevalent view: coding as a hobby.

For me, coding outside of work is generally _not_ a hobby. Rather, my non-work
coding efforts are more accurately described as a regimen for maintaining both
professional fitness (i.e. employability and career progression, both now and
in the future) and core skill fitness (i.e. getting better at coding through
practice outside of any work/professional concerns).

Mind you, I have nothing against coding being an actual hobby. Let’s first
consider what a hobby is, before turning to regimens.

### What is a hobby?

If you ask me about my hobbies, I immediately think of _examples_, not
_definitions:_ Riding a bicycle, playing Lego with my kids, Star Wars, etc.

However, when I want to think more deeply on a topic, I like to use definitions
to make my thinking more precise. So, here’s a quite reasonable definition of
hobby:

> An activity or interest pursued for pleasure or relaxation and not as a main occupation
> 
> <cite>Dictionary.com [definition of hobby](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/hobby)</cite>

Such pithy definitions help me think faster: hobby = pleasurable and/or
relaxing activity. (I don’t think “not as a main occupation” matters all that
much. If you truly love coding both at work and outside of work, more power to
you.)

### Do you find coding outside of work pleasurable or relaxing?

That’s a serious question. I generally don’t, but the reasons for this are
nuanced.

I don’t find coding all that relaxing during the work week. At the end of a
work day, I am mentally depleted from 8+ hours of focusing on either actual
coding or related get-work-done tasks. I usually find it more relaxing to let
my mind “switch gears” in the evening to another topic, such as reading a book
or learning Adobe Illustrator.

However, on the weekend, the situation is different. My mind has detached more
from “work coding” and is thus more refreshed, so I can honestly enjoy small
code excursions, especially on creative, rather than technical, projects. But
I’m talking about maybe 60 minutes at a time, tops. There is the popular image
of the “hacker” staying up all night to finish something great, but I like my
sleep (always have, always will), and am also fine with incremental progress
over time.

That’s just me, though;
[YMMV](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/ymmv).
Ultimately, _what_ you do with code should matter more than _when_ or _for how
long_. Which leads us to the next topic.

### Is it obvious what to “do” or “make” with code outside of work?

Some hobbies are more obvious (e.g. going for a bike ride) and some less so
(e.g. building your own bike), in terms of why to do it, how to do it, how long
it will take or how much it will cost, what you’ll get out of it in the end,
etc.

I don’t think it’s completely obvious what to “do” or “make” with code as a
hobby, but a lot of this depends on your background (e.g. are you a
[Maker](https://makezine.com/2016/04/01/what-is-a-maker-you-are/) who is used
to making things with code and other technology?). Here’s a great example of
this sentiment from Reddit:

> I know this might sound like a silly question but I’m really serious. I really wanna start coding as a hobby but I have no clue what I can do with coding at a non professional/career level. Can someone give me some ideas of what I as a brand new coder can/will be able to do with practice besides make a calculator?

I don’t think this is a silly question at all. For example, a lot of the
available tooling (language, libraries, frameworks, IDEs, etc) has historically
been quite clunky and off-putting, and much of it still is. But things are
changing. For example, check out [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), a
website/IDE/community that is trying to make coding more fun, approachable, and
social all in one go.

Discussing what to do or make with hobby code is a topic unto itself. But if I
had to give one suggestion, I’d say **make games** (for yourself/friends; don’t
expect the gaming world to beat a path to your game these days). Why? Because
games are nearly perfect microcosms to explore. Want to play around with
graphics, networking, AI, scripting, etc? Games can do all that and more. Heck,
you can even read [Making Games with Python and
Pygame](https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/) online for free. To maximize
learning, skip Unity and build your own engine and foundations.

Thus, coding as a hobby might make sense for you, if you do it for the right
reasons. But there are other ways to code outside of work. I prefer the regimen
approach, which I’ll discuss next.

## What is a regimen?

First, let’s start with the definition of regimen:

> a) Systematic plan (as of diet, therapy, or medication) especially when designed to improve and maintain the health of a patient
> 
> b) A regular course of action and especially of strenuous training
> 
> <cite>Merriam-Webster.com [definition of regimen](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/regimen)  
> </cite>

So, hobby = pleasurable and/or relaxing activity, and regimen = systematic,
regular plan for training, maintenance, and improvement. These are different
goals. There is meaningful overlap (e.g. making progress in a regimen is
extremely rewarding/pleasurable), but they really are different aims.

## Why adopt a coding regimen?

Just as health regimens promote fitness and well-being, coding regimens promote
the fitness and improvement of your most important skill as a software
developer: your ability to get stuff done with code.

#### Coding for professional fitness

In the introduction, I gave two key reasons for adopting a coding regimen. The
first is for professional fitness. This is hugely important. If you are “set
for life” financially (i.e. you could stop working tomorrow and still provide
for your family for the next 20-30 years, and retire after), good for you. If
not, you should take your career trajectory seriously. What’s more, if you are
a software developer, your career ultimately depends on your ability to get
stuff done with code.

I don’t believe that a software developer _job_, let alone a _career_, is
guaranteed. Not by your current employer, and not by any future employer
either. In California at least, most software developers are [at-will
employees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-will_employment), which roughly
means you can be let go without reason, so long as the company isn’t acting
illegally. And even if the action was illegal, legal recourse takes
considerable time, money, and energy, assuming you aren’t bound by [forced
arbitration](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rakeenmabud/2019/02/26/worker-organizing-results-in-big-change-at-google).

Furthermore, historically many software developers [are
younger](https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-age-programmer-2015-4)
and haven’t lived through many recessions (my point of view is based on the
US). I caught the tail end of the Dot Com bust in 2002 as I was graduating
college, and the startup I was working for went under in the Great Recession of
2007-2009\. Safe to say, I generally do not recommend looking for a new job in
a recession: more competition for fewer available jobs. That situation is both
hard to succeed in, and often psychologically demoralizing.

This topic—staying employed or employable in good times and bad—is just the tip
of the iceberg for professional fitness. Other topics include ensuring
predictable career progression (at your current employer or elsewhere), being
able to “pivot” from one technology track to another, staying sharp as you get
older, etc. For all these reasons, a coding regimen to ensure professional
health and longevity is vital for many of us.

#### Coding for core skill fitness

I believe it’s important to develop your core coding skill outside of work and
professional concerns. Yes, your job and career are important. But coding is a
skill like being able to do math well. It’s a technical pursuit bigger than any
one job or career.

Coding as a core skill can be broken down into many dimensions for learning and improvement:

*   Which languages you know, and how well you know them
*   Developing foundational skills (algorithms, data structures, compilers, databases, networking, etc).
*   Developing specialized skills (web, mobile, machine learning, distributed systems, etc).
*   Building stuff from scratch (website, mobile app, machine learning model, etc).
*   And more!

If the majority of your coding is done at work, for work, the natural question
is: **does your coding at work actually develop (with breadth and depth) your
core coding skills?** The more the answer is “no”, the more you should augment
your work coding with a non-work regimen.

Everyone’s experience here will be wildly different. In my experience (16+
years of professional coding), work responsibilities and core coding skill
development only partially overlap. In general, work is about **solving
business goals and delivering business value**. Coding is just a part of that
mission, and many non-coding skills are equally important: picking the right
problems to solve; avoiding
[NIH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here); working across teams to
get the job done; making tough decisions and gathering consensus in the face of
disagreement or indecision; etc. Thus, for many roles (especially leads or
managers), the amount of time spent coding becomes negligible. If you want to
keep learning, you have to do it yourself.

For example, the opportunities to **truly build something from scratch** have
decreased over time for me in my own career. However, in my experience,
building from scratch is orders of magnitude more effective for learning than
just hacking on existing code. That’s why series like [Handmade
Hero](https://www.youtube.com/user/handmadeheroarchive) are utterly invaluable,
even if you aren’t into games.

Many coders focus on their core skill development in the beginning, e.g. at
university, college, or (these days) boot camp. The more recent that training
was, the fresher it will be in your brain. But I started university over 20
years ago; those learning experiences feel distant now. Rather than lament
[lost time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time), though, I
can see the chance to keep learning as an opportunity: I’m smarter now, have
way more practiced experience, and can actually understand the deep details
quicker and better. While I have a fraction of the time now, my learning is
more focused and productive. [Constraints can be
empowering](https://www.fastcompany.com/3067925/how-constraints-force-your-brain-to-be-more-creative).

### What does my coding regimen look like?

These days, it’s very simple out of necessity. I try to spend 1-2 hours a week
outside of work coding. That’s it. Nobody said a regimen _has_ to be strenuous
at all times. You can ease in and out of different levels of intensity.

How do I focus my efforts? I really prefer working through books. I am
currently working through [Learning
R](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-r/9781449357160/). It’s a
bit dry, so I tackle it in 15-20 minute chunks, and am ~35% done. Side projects
are good too, but books give you a guided, steady way to learn a new topic.

I am also a huge fan of the spacing effect:

> The **spacing effect** is the phenomenon whereby learning is greater when studying is spread out over time, as opposed to studying the same amount of content in a single session.
> 
> <cite>Wikipedia on [spacing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)</cite>

By working in small chunks, I learn more frequently and regularly over time.
Even when I am learning a new bit, I have to go back and review the old bits to
keep them readily at my fingertips when typing. For me, this works worlds
better than cramming.

### Conclusion

So there you have it. Yes, coding can be a hobby. But for me, in practice,
coding is more like a regimen I do for my well-being.

This distinction is important to me. I want my hobbies to be hobbies and my
regimens to be regimens. Sure there is overlap, but each requires its own
purpose and focus.

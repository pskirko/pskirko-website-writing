# Coding as a hobby? For me, non-work coding is mostly a regimen akin to going to the gym

Sometime in the last decade or so, "coding as a hobby" emerged as a theme at
large.

I share the above quote in earnest. I don't think it's overwhelmingly
obvious (even after 18+ years of doing it) why coding can be a real hobby (not
just professional development by another name) at a massive scale, and even if
it is for you, it's even less obvious to newcomers what you can realistically
accomplish with code that's actually interesting outside of work. By
interesting, I mean you can do something with code and then show the result to
your non-coding parents or family or friends, and they'd genuinely say "oh,
interesting!" Making an interesting visual calculator probably passes this test
for many, but configuring a reverse proxy? Not so much, I'd wager. Installing a
new package manager? Fuggetaboutit.

If you are already skilled in the art, you're probably thinking, "Oh sure
it's easy! Just hook up a React frontend to an NLP service and voila! Talking
head on a webpage. Hey you can even run it on a Pi! Why not animate the face in
WebGL..." And in a sense you are right, if you are making certain assumptions
about your audience, because there is a continuum from newcomers to people
already skilled, and the people who already know more can do more, and such a
project might be relatively straightforward, taken one step at a time. But to
the newcomer, is such a project 6 months or 6 years of learning and tinkering
at night? Hard to say at a glance.

The "coding as hobby" topic is everywhere. "thecoderschool" has

Again, I share these links in earnest. The subtexts here are quite real. For
example, journalism (traditional and "new media") as an industry is in a
[real tough spot](https://www.thecut.com/2019/02/vice-layoffs-buzzfeed-huffpost-media.html).
And many parents very well understand that
coding is still a dominant career path for the next few decades, so the
pressure for kids to start early (whether they enjoy it or not) is real.

For decades, becoming a professional software engineer generally meant
getting a 4-year degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and the
like. Some people got industry jobs with "non-traditional" backgrounds, but
statistically I believe they were the exception (although I have no concrete
stat to back this up. It's just based on my own perception of company workforce
composition at big companies like Adobe back in the day).

But that's changed. If you are interested in the Web platform and using
Javascript, you can go through a coding bootcamp program and stand a good
chance of getting a job after. There were no bootcamps that I can recall in
2002; at best, you bought dead-tree O'Reilly books and taught yourself.
Similarly, to become a Data Scientist using R or Python, you can study at
[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) online
([est. 2013](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/data-camp)).

Thus, the "onramps" to a coding career are increasing. And positioning
coding as a hobby is really another onramp, because it makes the idea of
learning to code less daunting for many. Coding bootcamps cost real money, and
online courses do as well (Udacity ain't cheap, although Udemy, and good ol'
fashioned e-books, are much more reasonably priced if your interest is in
learning, not "accreditation"). As a hobby, you can start coding slowly, using
free materials online, and there's less pressure to "make it something" off the
bat. This is genuinely important in opening up coding careers to more people,
and to not sink too much money into it if you're not even sure it's a fit for
you.

But, as I said above, for me it's generally not a hobby (with a few small
projects of mine, like learning Processing, being an exception, as my time
spent on them is infrequent). I conjecture that the majority of people picking
up coding as a hobby these days are doing it to "test the waters" and see if a
coding career makes sense for them. I further conjecture that the number of
people picking up coding purely as a hobby and who have no intention of being a
professional programmer of some kind are in the statistical minority.

My hobbies are conventional hobbies: learning to draw, learning to play
guitar, bicycling, etc. For me, coding outside of work is a mental and
skill-based "exercise" regimen, akin to going to the gym. I'm doing it to stay
sharp, especially on things I don't do at my day job.

Of course,
[Processing](https://processing.org/)
is a great exception to call out. It is a part of the "creative coding" movement,
and using it is the closest I've felt to programming being an actual hobby,
because its creative, visual, and has a diverse community. But in terms of
actual time spent, it's still in the minority for me. Sadly, somewhat. I keep
trying to change that, but there's only so many hours in the day.

The fact is, there is real pressure to "stay sharp". There is no guarantee
that what I know, or work on, now will keep me actively employable 10 years
from now. 10 years ago (2009), I was still doing C# and .NET on the desktop.
The desktop! For most coders, desktop programming today means two things: the
browser, and
[Electron](https://electronjs.org/),
which is really a Redux of the browser tech stack. Some platforms rise, and some go by
the wayside, not to disappear, but to rot slowly. And heck, some even rise
again, virtualized (DOSBox anyone?). So until I find my multi-decade groove, I
need to treat coding outside of work as a regimen of professional fitness.

Is it still enjoyable? Often. I genuinely enjoy learning, just as I enjoy
going to the gym to get in better physical health. To me, "regimen" is not a
pejorative; rather, it's an emphasis on discipline over time. So when I pick
topics I'm truly interested in, the regimen is quite enjoyable and sustainable.
If I pick something not because I actually like it but because I feel obliged
somehow to learn or know it, then it's a drag. More on this another time.</p>

So to summarize:

* For some, coding can in fact be an honest to goodness hobby, like
  bicycling, done primarily for pleasure and is its own end. For me, coding a
  very tiny hobby time-wise. But that's still important.</li><li>For many, coding
  as a hobby is an onramp to coding as a career. And that's important and useful
  too.
* For many others, coding outside of work is not so much a hobby,
  but really just ongoing professional development. And that's important as well,
  but I prefer to call this a "regimen" to avoid confusion with the other
  meanings of hobby.

# Post Update

I recently updated my post on how to write good blog posts. You can read the updated version [here](https://www.pskirko.com/2015/07/04/how-to-write-good-blog-posts/).

In this new version, I get much closer to capturing the points I want to get across. I use these guidelines as I write new posts and edit older ones.

Happy reading!

# OK Medium, you win. For now.

Note: This was migrated from my old Medium blog. I have decided to migrate from Medium to WordPress, and I’ll write about the reasons why soon, stay tuned.

Call me old school, but I believe that a personal website is an essential part of your identity on the Web, a necessary counterpoint to the curated social media game (Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, etc). For coders, a canonical example is Jeff Atwood’s [codinghorror.com](http://codinghorror.com/).

I made my first personal website in 1998. I can’t even remember anymore if I hosted it on the college intranet or actually had a domain name. Really, I just wanted a motivation for making graphics in Photoshop. There wasn’t much real content. I’m no Jeff Atwood.

The [current incarnation](http://www.pskirko.com/) of my personal website is very much like [punctuated equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium). I’m still no Jeff Atwood.

Despite my fondness for that particular form of unrealized ambition, I have decided to use [Medium](https://medium.com/@Medium) as my writing platform. Maybe one day I’ll repatriate, but for now I will write here.

The reasons for this decision are twofold:

*   I don’t have the time or overwhelming inclination to tinker with self-hosted blog platforms ([WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)) or brain-involving static site generators ([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)), SEO, etc. My [current website](http://www.pskirko.com/) is basically static HTML constructed using the simplest generator I could find, [harp.js](http://harpjs.com/), basically to preprocess includes.
*   I buy the argument that [Medium](https://medium.com/@Medium) can get my writing in front of more eyeballs, relative to the reach of my personal website in the absence of massive and tedious (for me and you) self-promotion (e.g. constantly tweeting links).

And the funny thing is, Jeff Atwood even explained how to become Jeff Atwood. [Read it here](https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step/), but here’s a teaser for starters:

> I don’t care if you have [nothing interesting to say](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000297.html). If you can demonstrate a willingness to write, and a desire to keep continually improving your writing, you will eventually be successful. — Jeff Atwood, [How To Achieve Ultimate Blog Success In One Easy Step](https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step/) (2007)

That’s simple, sincere, good advice. So really, as much as I love the personal website as a _thing_, the more important thing is to take the path of least resistance towards writing more frequently. And that’s why Medium wins. For now.

# The qualities of good online writing

Note: This was migrated from my old Medium blog. I have decided to migrate from Medium to WordPress, and I’ll write about the reasons why soon, stay tuned.
In general, I am a curmudgeon about the quality of online writing, specifically blog writing. But, my perspective is skewed. As a coder, I have mostly read coding-related blogs, and to be blunt, few coders are exemplary writers. Usually that’s fine, because sufficiently strong content compensates for weak form. And there are exceptions, such as [objc.io](https://www.objc.io/issues/).

Personally though, I aim for the both-and goal of good writing and good content.

Thus, before I develop my own blogging any further, I find it necessary to explicitly and succinctly state what I see as the qualities of good online writing, to keep me focused.

IMHO, good online writing is:

1. Unique. Unique is many things. To me, it means being personal and sincere above all.
2. Logically strong. To me, “logic” means accurately capturing the depth of our thought, both rationally and emotionally. Points are made with thoughtfulness and care. Focus on constructive thinking, rather than reactions.
3. Examples, example, examples.
4. Not too long, not too short. No rambling, lack of editing, or self-indulgence. That said, the writing should still be long enough to have room to express and develop interesting thoughts.

These points aren’t specific to online writing, but that’s the medium I’m focusing on.

> I am for richness of meaning rather than clarity of meaning; for the implicit function as well as the explicit function. I prefer “both-and” to “either-or,” black and white, and sometimes gray, to black or white. — Robert Venturi, Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture (1966)

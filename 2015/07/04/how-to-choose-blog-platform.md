# OK Medium, you win. For now.

Call me old school, but I believe that a personal website is an essential part
of your identity on the Web, a necessary counterpoint to the curated social
media game (Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, etc). For coders, a canonical example
is Jeff Atwood’s
[codinghorror.com](http://codinghorror.com/).

I made my first personal website in 1998. I can’t even remember anymore if I
hosted it on the college intranet or actually had a domain name. Really, I just
wanted a motivation for making graphics in Photoshop. There wasn’t much real
content. I’m no Jeff Atwood.

The
[current incarnation](https://www.pskirko.com/)
of my personal website is very much like
[punctuated equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium).
I’m still no Jeff Atwood.

Despite my fondness for that particular form of unrealized ambition, I have
decided to use Medium as my writing platform. Maybe one day I’ll repatriate,
but for now I will write here.

The reasons for this decision are twofold:

I don’t have the time or overwhelming inclination to tinker with self-hosted
blog platforms (
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/),
[Ghost](https://ghost.org/)) or brain-involving static site generators
([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)),
SEO, etc. My
[current website](https://www.pskirko.com/) is basically static HTML constructed
using the simplest generator I could find,
[harp.js](http://harpjs.com/),
basically to preprocess
includes.  I buy the argument that Medium can get my writing in front of more
eyeballs, relative to the reach of my personal website in the absence of
massive and tedious (for me and you) self-promotion (e.g. constantly tweeting
links).
And the funny thing is, Jeff Atwood even explained how to become Jeff Atwood.
[Read it here](https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step/),
but here’s a teaser for starters:

That’s simple, sincere, good advice. So really, as much as I love the personal
website as a thing, the more important thing is to take the path of least
resistance towards writing more frequently. And that’s why Medium wins. For
now.
